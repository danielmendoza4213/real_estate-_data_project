Collecting Data
Repository: challenge-collecting-data
Type of Challenge: Consolidation
Duration: 3 days
Deadline: 29/01/2021 16:00
Team challenge : Group of 3
Mission objectives
Use a python library to collect as much data as possible.

At the end of this challenge, you should :

Be able to scrape a website
Be able to build a dataset from scratch
Be able to Implement a strategy to collect as much data as possible.
The Mission
The real estate company "ImmoEliza" wants to create a machine learning model to make price predictions on real estate sales in Belgium. You must therefore create a dataset that holds the following columns :

Locality
Type of property (House/apartment)
Subtype of property (Bungalow, Chalet, Mansion, ...)
Price
Type of sale (Exclusion of life sales)
Number of rooms
Area
Fully equipped kitchen (Yes/No)
Furnished (Yes/No)
Open fire (Yes/No)
Terrace (Yes/No)
If yes: Area
Garden (Yes/No)
If yes: Area
Surface of the land
Surface area of the plot of land
Number of facades
Swimming pool (Yes/No)
State of the building (New, to be renovated, ...)
You must save everything in a csv file.

Must-have features
Data for all of Belgium.
Minimum 10 000 inputs
No empty row. If you are missing information, set the value to None.
Miscellanous information
Be careful not to have duplicates. The dataset must be clean. Try as much as possible to record only numerical values. Example: Instead of defining whether the kitchen is equipped with a "Yes", use binary values.
